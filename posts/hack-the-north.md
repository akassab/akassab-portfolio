Hack the North is Canada's biggest Hackathon. Because of Covid-19, Hack the North 2020++ was their first fully remote Hackathon. I volunteered to help host a GraphQL workshop, mentored, and debugged multiple projects.

# GraphQL Workshop

- Moderated a live group chat with over 250+ participants.
- Created intractable code snippets to engage with the audience.
- Provided **GraphQL** knowledge and caching practices.

# Mentor and Technical Assistant

- Debug participants' **React**, **Node.js**, and **Flask** bugs.
- Provided step-by-step tutorials on **web-scraping**, **JavaScript DOM**, and **Chrome developer tools** to participants.
