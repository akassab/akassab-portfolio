NERv Technology is a health-tech startup creating a monitoring system and device aiming to reduce a surgeon's response time to surgical accidents, improve patient recovery, and save lives.

At NERv Technology, I worked a hybrid work schedule with the Software Engineering Lead on various systems requiring shifting back and forth between different frameworks and languages. I improved backend security, added features to their Android tablet, developed a migration system, and debugged and re-architected old code/design decisions.

# Here are my achievements:

- Improved backend server security by mitigating DDoS attacks with the Sliding Windows Counter algorithm, implemented as middleware on **ASP.NET Core 3** (**C#**) with **Redis**, resulting in $9000 in yearly savings and a 12% reduced in-memory footprint.
- Implement a data-export feature using **Kotlin** and **RealmDB** on the clinical trial team's **Android** tablet application, allowing users to export all patient info, device info, and sensor data associated with the tablet into an encrypted zip folder containing .csv and .json and workbook files.
- Implemented a note-taking feature with **Kotlin** and **RealmDB** on the clinical trial team's **Android** tablet application to let users take notes while calibrating inline devices.
- Implemented a client-driven database migration system using serverless Azure functions and Queue Storage to let the studies team manually send entries from an old **CosmosDB** to a newer instance.
- Created unit tests with **xUnit.net**, wrote QA reports, and leveraged design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, Singleton) and data structures (Queues, Hash Tables) for each pull request.

# Tech Stack:

- ASP.NET Core 3 (C#, xUnit.net)
- Android Studio (Kotlin, Java, XML, RealmDB)
- Azure (Redis, CosmosDB, Queue Storage)
- BitBucket (git)
- Jira
- Microsoft Teams
- Excel
