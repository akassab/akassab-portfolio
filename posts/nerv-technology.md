NERv technology is a health-tech startup working on a monitoring system and device which reduces a surgen’s response time to surgical accidents, improves patient recovery, and saves lives.

At Nerv, I implemented new features and improved on existing implementations using Software Engineering principles learned from my fourth year courses and all the experienced gained throughout my previous internships and projects.

I worked a hybrid work schedule with the Software Engineering Lead on various systems requiring shifting back and forth between different frameworks and languages.

I improved backend security, added features to their Android application, developed a migration system, debugged and re-architected old code and design decisions.
Tech Stack:

- ASP.NET Core 3 (C#)
- Android Studio (Kotlin, Java, XML, RealmDB)
- Redis)
- Azure

Bullet-point achievements:

Improved backend server security by mitigating DDoS attacks with the Sliding Windows Counter algorithm implemented with C# as middleware on ASP.NET Core 3, resulting in $9000 in yearly savings and 12% reduced in-memory footprint.
Used the Strategy design pattern and Kotlin Services to implement a data-export feature on the Clinical Trial team’s Android application, which organizes thousands of sensor measurements into a single zip folder.
Implemented a client-driven database migration system using serverless functions, allowing the clinical studies team to manually choose which sensor data to migrate over to a newer database from their tablet application.
