At Rocket Doctor, I kicked off their React.js to Next.js migration
roadmap by re-creating their patient funnel applications using a
more scalable and maintainable approach. Rocket Doctor's presence was (and still is)
growing in many regions across the United States and Canada. I thought
the Engineering team needed a faster way to create new patient booking
forms with all the necessary 3rd party integrations; I came up with an idea which
would allow developers to create forms within a few minutes; the library was built
in a fashion no longer requiring merging of new backend logic.

On the side, I helped out with their Ruby on Rails to Node.js migration roadmap,
automated end-to-end testing with Cypress scripts for 5 web pages, and wrote middleware
to improve backend security.

Tech Stack:

- Next.js, React.js (JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS)
- Node.js (TypeScript)
- PostgreSql (SQL)
- Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
- Cypress
