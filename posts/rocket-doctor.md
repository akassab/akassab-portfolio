Rocket Doctor is a telemedicine company building patient management software and patient booking forms for Doctors in North America.

At Rocket Doctor, I worked a fully remote work schedule with a team of four senior engineers. I started by contributing to their Ruby-on-Rails to Node.js migration roadmap, then designing a highly customizable form-building tool to streamline the development of all their current and future patient appointment forms.

# Here are my achievements:

- Architected and implemented an abstract **React** form builder library with **Express.js (TypeScript)**, and **PostgreSQL (TypeORM)** featuring Slack, Google Sheet, and SendGrid API integrations to streamline the development of all patient onboarding forms.
- Deployed five patient onboarding forms and leveraged Segment API, Google Tag Manager, and Google Pixel Trackers to conduct usability tracking and saw 54,000 visitors that year.
- Improved back-end security by writing Sanitizers and Validators for **Node.js** API endpoints.
- Improved front-end app performance by re-creating forms in **Next.js** and implementing component memoization and persistent states using React Hooks.
- Assisted in their Ruby-on-Rails to Node.js migration roadmap by re-creating API endpoints in **Express.js**.
- Increased cross-browser compatibility and improved mobile UX by designing responsive components with **Material UI** and **CSS**.
- Created design documents and end-to-end tests using **Cypress**, **Mocha**, and **Chai**.

Tech Stack:

- Next.js, React.js (JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS)
- Node.js (Express.js, TypeScript)
- PostgreSQL (SQL, TypeORM)
- Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
- Cypress, Mocha, Chai
