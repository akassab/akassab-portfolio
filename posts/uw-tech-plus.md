After enrolling back in school after working at Rocket Doctor, I picked up another opportunity to continue networking with others having similar interests. I stumbled across UW Tech Plus - a student organization that aims to support students from all backgrounds, to be confident, knowledgeable, and empowered to pursue a career in the tech industry.

I volunteered by mentoring students enrolled in computer science, math, and engineering for four consecutive semesters. I helped by providing students tips I wish I knew before and resources to help students get started with small projects and places to apply.

I believe that a successful person who doesn't start to mentor others will, over time, lose touch with their excellence.
